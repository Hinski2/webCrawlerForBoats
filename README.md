# Ship Data Automation Project

This project automates the process of extracting information about ships and their parameters from a website and storing it in an Excel file. The automation significantly reduces the manual effort required to transfer data from the web to a structured format.

## Project Overview

The notebook contains the following key steps:

1. **Getting Names of Countries**: Extracts the names of countries related to the ships.
2. **Creating Function for Processing Country**: Defines a function to handle the extraction of data for each country.
3. **Processing One Boat**: Demonstrates the extraction process for a single ship.
4. **Making Database**: Aggregates the data into a structured database.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `main.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Execute the cells sequentially to extract and store the ship data.
